# mamba
There are 3 common python package managers. These are
- pip (standard, install packages locally, can create version conflicts between modules)
- conda (can create virtual environments, prevents version conflicts between modules, costs money)
- mamba (similar to conda but free)
Mamba is the best package manager and should be installed on your machine. 
When you install packages only do this inside a virtual environment (see mamba.md in this folder).

# Firefox
When using the python module Jupyter Lab, you need a browser, in which the module can start.
I highly recommend Firefox for this.
# VS Code + Copilot
Coding is much more efficient with an AI Tool like Copilot.
For that reason install VS Code as an IDE and use Github Copilot.
# ChatGPT
When it comes to structural questions or brainstorming for ideas, ChatGPT is very good.
It is also a good partner with Copilot to find the solution for coding problems.
