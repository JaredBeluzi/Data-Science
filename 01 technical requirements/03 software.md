You need to install the latest python version.

# mamba
There are 3 common python package managers. These are
- pip (standard, install packages locally, can create version conflicts between modules)
- conda (can create virtual environments, prevents version conflicts between modules, costs money)
- mamba (similar to conda but free)
Mamba is the best package manager and should be installed on your machine. 
When you install packages only do this inside a virtual environment (see mamba.md in this folder).

# Firefox
When using the python module Jupyter Lab, you need a browser, in which the module can start.
I highly recommend Firefox for this.
